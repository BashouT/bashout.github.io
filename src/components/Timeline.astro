                    Responsible for the maintainance and further feature
                    delivery of multiple social care focused integration
                    applications. This includes the delivery of a new financial
                    solution which enabled the business to clawback significant
                    overspend due to historically poor commissioning which had
                    been recently improved due to internally developed portals
                    which allowed more dynamic, automated commissioning.

                <p>
                    Working within a Scrum team of seven members where I scrum
                    mastered and also worked to deliver a bespoke portal
                    allowing the collection of service delivery from third party
                    organisations. Also delivered a nationally recognised social
                    care commissioning portal for NCC which allowed more rapid
                    movement of patients from hospital to home based care. Part
                    of this work involved reverse engineering a very
                    undocumented interaction method with the key social care
                    system and writing an API that makes this idempotent and
                    safe for multiple third party applications to consume. Also
                    helped design and develop the Firmstep scanner evolving into
                    a permissions monitoring tool which ultimately was purchased
                    by Granicus and formed the basis of their permissions tool
                    still used today.

                <p>
                    Working to make custom integrations with the authority's
                    social care system over a SOAP based API, implementing
                    custom business logic within a Web API application that took
                    user input from GovService (at the time Firmstep). Also
                    developed custom forms and form templates for use across a
                    number of the authority's workflows within GovService, such
                    as the user lookup and it's associated backend API. Limited
                    experience delivering a GovService workflow which took data
                    from an API, transformed it using the built in XSLT
                    stylesheet functionality to show only relevant data from the
                    third party endpoint to the end user. Rearchitecting a
                    heavily over-schedule undelivered day care solution so that
                    it could be delivered to the business and begin providing
                    value.
